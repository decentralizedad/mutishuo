# 🧠 Mutishuo Integration Architecture

**Lemon Squeezy (Referral + Payment) → GPT Apps (Interaction + Logic) → Output Layer (Results + Meaning)**

---

## 🧩 1. Lemon Squeezy = Referral + Monetization Layer

| Role                 | What It Does                                                      |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 💰 Handles payment   | One-time, subscription, or product access                         |
| 🔗 Tracks referrals  | Affiliate system with % commission for mentors / creators         |
| 🧾 Issues receipts   | Includes VAT, branded checkout, PDF invoice                       |
| 🔁 Optional redirect | After payment, user is sent to GPT onboarding or frequency portal |

✅ *Each product (e.g. Soul Profile Kit, GPT Role Generator) includes built-in referral and is accessible via link or QR.*

---

## 🤖 2. GPT = Application Layer (All Core Intelligence Happens Here)

| GPT Role               | Example Products       | Input → Output                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🌌 Soul Profiler       | Soul Profile Generator | User answers questions → GPT returns 3-part narrative (e.g. core archetype, pattern, mission) |
| 🧠 Life Script Decoder | AI反推人生剧本               | Life events + tone → GPT outputs roles, cycles, default script                                |
| 🧬 Role Generator      | GPT角色创造机               | GPT helps user design avatar/mentor role (used in theater/team)                               |
| 🏢 Org Rater           | 企业频率评分器                | Team traits → GPT produces multi-axis analysis + coaching tip                                 |
| 📖 Prompt Builder      | 频率型提示词生成器              | Input: topic/intent → Output: ready-to-use GPT prompt bundle                                  |

✅ *Each GPT app is a standalone logic engine (hosted on web, server, or GPT plugin) and activated only after verified purchase.*

## 🔎 3. Explanation Layer = GPT Narrator + Frequency Context

| Function                                           | How It Works                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✨ GPT Result Narration                             | After GPT gives raw result, a second GPT interprets it in "Mutishuo" language      |
| 📖 Frequency Glossary                              | Each output includes spiritual/theater tags like “Archetype: Wanderer → Alchemist” |
| 📡 Frequency Contribution Report                   | Optional summary shows how your result contributes to “The Mother Theater”         |
| 🧭 Prompt: "Explain to me like I'm in the theater" | Every app includes a “Narrate my result” button for deep insight                   |

✅ *This makes the experience memorable, narrative-driven, and sharable. Every user leaves with “a role in the drama.”*

Thank you for requesting MFIEV (MotherTheory Frequency Index for Enterprise Vitality) scores for **BYD**, **Nvidia**, **Apple**, **Huawei**, and **SpaceX**. Below, I’ll apply the MFIEV framework to assess each company as a “theater node” within the MotherTheory (Mutishuo) paradigm, scoring them on the four main dimensions (Soul Script Richness, Theater Structural Openness, High-Frequency Soul Retention & Release, AI Integration & Co-Creation Capability) and the Frequency Perception metric. Each sub-metric is rated from 1 to 5, with the total score normalized to 0–50. I’ll incorporate recent web data (e.g., Huawei’s AI chip developments) where relevant, critically examining sources to align with MotherTheory’s metaphysical lens. The assessments will include diagnoses, recommendations, and ties to Q1–Q100, formatted for potential Substack or website integration.
